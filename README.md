VulTR: Software Vulnerability Detection Model Based on Multi-layer Key Feature Enhancement

Software vulnerabilities pose a huge threat to current network security, which continues to lead to data leaks and system damage. In order to effectively identify and patch these vulnerabilities, researchers have proposed automated detection methods based on deep learning. However, most of the existing methods only rely on single-dimensional data representation and fail to fully explore the composite characteristics of the code. Among them, the sequence embedding method fails to effectively capture the structural characteristics of the code, while the graph embedding method focuses more on the global characteristics of the overall graph structure and is still insufficient in optimizing the representation of nodes. In view of this, this paper constructs the VulTR model, which incorporates an importance assessment mechanism to strengthen the key syntax levels of the source code (from lexical elements to nodes and graph-level structures), significantly improving the importance of key vulnerability features in classification decisions. At the same time, a relationship connection diagram is constructed to describe the spatial characteristics of the correlations between functions. Experimentally verified, VulTR's F1 scores on both synthetic and real data sets exceed those of the compared models (VulDeePecker, SySeVR, Devign, VulCNN, IVDetect, and mVulPreter).
